# CODEOWNERS file
# This file defines who is responsible for reviewing changes to the repository.
# Patterns on the left match files/folders; owners on the right are GitHub usernames or teams.
# Because of branch protection rules, any matching owner must approve a Pull Request before it can be merged.

# Default owner for all files in the repo (everything matched by '*')
